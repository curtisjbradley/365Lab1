# Lab Writeup

### Team Members: Curtis Bradley

### Initial Decisions

When I first started the project I began implementation using Python. 
After implementing parsing of user input I decided to switch to Java for an OOP approach.
Java allows access to the stream type which allows easy filtering functionality that is necessary with a querying program.

### Task Estimates

- Input parsing (15 minutes)
- Student file deserialization (20 minutes)
- Quit (3 minutes)
- Info (10 minutes)
- Average (10 minutes)
- Student (15 minutes)
- Teacher (10 minutes)
- Bus (10 minutes)
- Grade (30 minutes)
